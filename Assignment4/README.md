# Roulette Game

This is the fourth and final assigment in CS 401. The goal was to create a GUI for the game of Roulette which would also hold players names, passwords, password questions, and money within a text file. This text file would also update as the game would go on. The game must allow for the 4 different bet types: Value, Color, Range, and Parity. Debt should also be allocated and shown.

# How to run

The main file for this program is called "Assig4.java". The "players.txt" file holds all of the players and their information. The number at the beginning of the file relates to the amount of players. The order of each row is the following: Name, Password, Money, Debt, Question 1, Answer 1, Question 2, Answer 2. If there are not questions for a player, then they cannot have their password recovered.
